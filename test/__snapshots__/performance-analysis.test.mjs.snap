<objective>
Primary goal: Identify performance bottlenecks with quantified complexity analysis, prioritized optimization recommendations, and measurement plans that distinguish critical issues from premature optimization

Secondary goals:
- Quantify each finding with Big-O complexity, estimated latency impact, and data-size scaling behavior
- Prioritize optimizations by (impact x frequency) / effort, applying Amdahl's Law to focus on dominant costs
- Provide specific profiling and benchmarking approaches for validating each recommendation
- Explicitly acknowledge areas where performance is acceptable to prevent wasted optimization effort

Success metrics:
- Every hot path annotated with time and space complexity
- Each bottleneck quantified with estimated impact at realistic data sizes
- Optimization recommendations include expected improvement factor and implementation effort
- Non-obvious concerns include profiling methodology before recommending changes
</objective>
<task>
Perform a systematic, measurement-driven performance analysis. The goal is to find real bottlenecks backed by evidence, not theoretical micro-optimizations. Every finding must be quantified. Every recommendation must estimate its expected improvement and the effort required to implement it.

Apply the core principle: measure first, optimize second. Focus analysis effort proportionally to where execution time is actually spent (Amdahl's Law). Flag O(n^2) or worse in hot paths as high priority. Acknowledge when code is already efficient.

[Performance Analysis Foundations]
**Amdahl's Law**: Speedup_overall = 1 / ((1 - P) + P/S) where P is the fraction of time spent in the optimized portion and S is the speedup of that portion. Optimizing code that accounts for 5% of execution time yields at most 5% overall improvement regardless of how fast you make it. Always identify where time is actually spent before optimizing.

**Complexity Classes (Big-O)** -- from best to worst:
- O(1): Constant -- hash table lookup, array index access, arithmetic
- O(log n): Logarithmic -- binary search, balanced BST operations
- O(n): Linear -- single-pass iteration, linear search
- O(n log n): Linearithmic -- comparison-based sorting (merge sort, quicksort average)
- O(n^2): Quadratic -- nested iteration over same collection, bubble sort
- O(n^3): Cubic -- naive matrix multiplication, three nested loops
- O(2^n): Exponential -- recursive power set, naive Fibonacci
- O(n!): Factorial -- brute-force permutation enumeration

When analyzing complexity, consider both worst-case and amortized complexity. A HashMap has O(1) amortized lookup but O(n) worst-case on hash collisions. Document which case applies.

**USE Method** (Utilization, Saturation, Errors): For infrastructure/resource analysis, check each resource (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, locks, thread pools):
- Utilization: What fraction of capacity is consumed? (>70% signals emerging bottleneck)
- Saturation: Is there queuing or backpressure? (run queue length, swap usage, disk queue depth; any non-zero saturation is a potential problem)
- Errors: Are there failures indicating resource exhaustion? (OOM kills, connection refused, timeout)
The USE Method solves approximately 80% of server performance issues when applied systematically.

**RED Method** (Rate, Errors, Duration): For service/endpoint analysis, monitor:
- Rate: Requests per second handled by each service
- Errors: Failed requests per second (HTTP 5xx, timeouts, application errors)
- Duration: Latency distribution of requests (p50, p95, p99 -- not just averages)
USE is for resources; RED is for services. Use both together for comprehensive coverage.

**Four Golden Signals** (Google SRE): Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation -- the four metrics Google recommends monitoring for all user-facing systems. These overlap with USE and RED but provide a unified monitoring lens.

**Performance Mantras** (Hanson & Crain, documented by Gregg): Optimization hierarchy -- prefer strategies higher on this list before resorting to lower ones:
1. Don't do it -- eliminate unnecessary work entirely
2. Do it, but don't do it again -- cache/memoize results
3. Do it less -- reduce frequency or scope of work
4. Do it later -- defer non-critical work (lazy evaluation, background jobs)
5. Do it when they're not looking -- async/background processing
6. Do it concurrently -- parallelize independent work
7. Do it cheaper -- use more efficient algorithms or data structures

**Common Anti-Patterns**:
- Premature optimization: optimizing code without measurement data showing it matters (Knuth: "about 97% of the time")
- N+1 queries: issuing one query per item instead of a batch query (common in ORM loops)
- Allocation in hot loops: creating objects/closures inside tight loops that could be hoisted
- Blocking I/O on async paths: synchronous file/network calls inside async functions
- Missing indexes: full table scans on filtered or joined columns
- Quadratic hidden in APIs: Array.includes/indexOf inside forEach/map creates O(n*m)
- String concatenation in loops: O(n^2) total allocation for immutable string types
- Excessive serialization: repeated JSON.parse/stringify or deep clone on hot paths

**Architectural Performance Anti-Patterns** (Smith & Williams):
- The Ramp: processing time increases over time (e.g., unbounded lists searched sequentially as they grow)
- Excessive Dynamic Allocation: frequent heap allocation/deallocation in hot paths causes GC pressure
- One Lane Bridge: bottleneck resource serializing concurrent work (e.g., single-threaded chokepoint)
- Circuitous Treasure Hunt: excessive indirection or hops to retrieve data
- Traffic Jam: overloaded resource causing cascading delays across dependent services
- Unbalanced Processing: work not distributed evenly across available resources

**Tail Latency Awareness**: Averages hide problems. Report percentile distributions:
- P50 (median): typical user experience; use for broad regression detection
- P95: 1-in-20 worst experience; use for system tuning
- P99: 1-in-100 worst experience (tail); exposes architectural bottlenecks
- P99.9: extreme outliers; critical for SLA compliance
Common tail latency causes: GC pauses, resource contention, cold caches, network jitter, lock contention.

**Analysis Anti-Methodologies to Avoid** (Gregg):
- Streetlight: using only familiar tools rather than systematically checking all resources
- Drunk Man: making random changes hoping problems disappear
- Blame-Someone-Else: redirecting issues to other teams without proper investigation
- Passive Benchmarking: running tools and presenting raw results without analysis or interpretation

[Language-Specific Performance Characteristics]
Performance characteristics and profiling tools differ by language runtime:

**JavaScript/TypeScript**: Single-threaded event loop with JIT compilation (V8). Key concerns: blocking the event loop with synchronous operations, excessive garbage collection from frequent allocations, prototype chain traversal, hidden class deoptimization. Profiling: Chrome DevTools Performance tab, node --prof, clinic.js.

**Python**: Interpreted with GIL restricting true parallelism. Key concerns: nested loops on large data (consider NumPy/Pandas vectorization), dynamic attribute lookup overhead, GIL contention in multi-threaded CPU-bound code. Profiling: cProfile, py-spy, line_profiler, memory_profiler.

**Java/Kotlin/JVM**: JIT-compiled with garbage collection. Key concerns: excessive object allocation triggering GC pauses, boxing/unboxing primitives, virtual method dispatch overhead, lock contention. Profiling: JFR (Java Flight Recorder), async-profiler, VisualVM, YourKit.

**Go**: Compiled with goroutine-based concurrency and GC. Key concerns: allocation in hot paths (escape analysis), channel contention, lock granularity, goroutine leaks. Profiling: pprof (CPU, heap, goroutine, mutex), trace tool.

**Rust/C++**: Compiled without GC. Key concerns: unnecessary cloning/copying, lock contention, cache locality (struct-of-arrays vs array-of-structs), branch prediction misses, Vec of Vec instead of flat backing arrays. Profiling: perf, Valgrind/Callgrind, Instruments, flamegraph.

**C#/.NET**: JIT-compiled with GC. Key concerns: excessive allocations (especially in hot paths), boxing, large object heap fragmentation, async state machine overhead. Profiling: dotTrace, PerfView, BenchmarkDotNet.

**Flame Graph Interpretation**: When profiling data includes flame graphs or CPU profiles, analyze them by: (1) identifying the widest bars at the top of the stack (functions consuming the most CPU directly), (2) tracing call paths from bottom to top to understand why hot functions are called, (3) looking for unexpected width (functions that should be cheap but consume disproportionate CPU), (4) comparing on-CPU and off-CPU flame graphs to distinguish CPU-bound from I/O-bound bottlenecks.

Follow the structured approach below.

<steps>
1. Understand
2. Analyze
3. Conclude
4. **Classify and contextualize**: Identify the programming language, framework, runtime environment, and the code's role (hot path handler, background job, startup initialization, etc.). This determines which performance concerns are relevant and which profiling tools to recommend.
5. **Identify hot paths**: Determine which code paths execute most frequently or process the largest data volumes. These are the only paths where optimization effort is justified per Amdahl's Law. Flag cold code (startup, rare branches) as low priority.
6. **Analyze algorithmic complexity**: For each hot path, determine Big-O time complexity and space complexity. Identify the dominant term and the variable(s) it depends on. Flag any O(n^2) or worse operations.
7. **Examine memory patterns**: Look for allocations inside loops, large object lifetimes preventing garbage collection, memory leaks from unclosed resources or retained references, and data structures with excessive overhead for their usage pattern.
8. **Audit I/O patterns**: Identify N+1 query patterns, unbatched network requests, blocking I/O on async code paths, missing database indexes (inferred from query patterns), and excessive serialization/deserialization.
9. **Evaluate concurrency**: Check for parallelization opportunities in CPU-bound work, lock contention or overly coarse locking, race conditions, thread/connection pool sizing, and async/await correctness (blocking calls in async contexts).
10. **Assess caching opportunities**: Identify repeated expensive computations, pure functions eligible for memoization, data that changes infrequently but is read often, and missing or ineffective cache invalidation.
11. **Quantify impact**: For each identified issue, estimate the performance cost at realistic data sizes (not just Big-O class, but concrete numbers: "O(n^2) with n=1000 = ~1M operations, approximately 200ms"). Use profiling data if available.
12. **Rank and prioritize**: Score each finding by (estimated_impact x execution_frequency) / implementation_effort. Apply Amdahl's Law: an optimization that speeds up 80% of execution time by 2x gives 1.6x overall speedup, but one that speeds up 5% by 10x gives only 1.05x. Apply the Performance Mantras hierarchy: prefer eliminating work over caching, caching over reducing, reducing over deferring, and so on.
13. **Evaluate against SLOs**: If performance requirements are provided, evaluate each bottleneck against those targets. Calculate whether the proposed optimizations would bring the system within its SLO. If no explicit SLOs exist, recommend establishing them with specific thresholds (e.g., "p99 latency below X ms at Y requests/second") as a prerequisite for ongoing performance management.
14. **Design measurement plan**: For each recommended optimization, specify how to measure the before/after difference: which profiling tool, which metric, what constitutes success, and how to detect regressions. Include guidance on benchmarking validity: sufficient warmup period, multiple runs for statistical significance, production-representative environment, and absence of confounding variables.

</when>
<when>
When no profiling data is provided and hot paths cannot be determined from code structure alone: State that hot path identification requires runtime profiling. Analyze all code paths for algorithmic complexity and flag any O(n^2) or worse operations regardless. Recommend profiling with specific tools before implementing any optimization.
</when>
<when>
When performance requirements are not specified: Analyze relative performance characteristics: identify the slowest operations, quantify their complexity, and flag clear inefficiencies. Note that absolute impact assessment requires defined performance targets and representative workload data.
</when>

When code appears already well-optimized: Acknowledge the good performance characteristics explicitly. Verify that optimizations are correct (e.g., cache invalidation works properly, concurrent code is thread-safe). Suggest monitoring approaches for detecting performance regression at scale.
</when>
<when>
When optimization requires significant architectural changes (caching layer, message queue, read replicas): Describe the architectural change and its expected impact, but also identify any incremental improvements achievable within the current architecture. Estimate effort for both approaches.
</when>
<when>
When profiling data contradicts expected complexity analysis: Trust the measurements over theoretical analysis. Investigate possible explanations: JIT optimization, CPU cache effects, OS-level buffering, measurement methodology issues. Report both the measured and theoretical values.

When code contains both performance-critical hot paths and initialization/setup code: Clearly separate analysis of hot-path code from cold-path code. Do not recommend optimizing initialization code unless it causes noticeable startup latency (greater than 1 second).
</when>
<when>
When tail latency (p99/p99.9) is dominated by runtime factors rather than algorithmic complexity (GC pauses, cold starts, JIT compilation, thread scheduling): Identify the runtime factor, distinguish it from application-level bottlenecks, and recommend runtime-specific mitigations: GC tuning parameters, warmup strategies, connection pool pre-warming, or off-heap data structures. Note that algorithmic optimization alone will not address runtime-induced tail latency.

<uncertainty-handling>
When confidence in a finding is less than high, state the confidence level and the specific uncertainty. Performance analysis must be data-driven, not speculative.

Use this calibration:
- **High confidence**: Algorithmic complexity is directly observable (nested loops, recursive calls without memoization). Recommendation: optimize.
- **Medium confidence**: Pattern suggests a likely issue but actual impact depends on data sizes or call frequency not visible in the code. Recommendation: measure first, then optimize if confirmed.
- **Low confidence**: Unclear whether the code path is hot, whether the data is large enough to matter, or whether runtime optimizations (JIT, caching) mitigate the theoretical cost. Recommendation: profile before spending any optimization effort.

Example: "This array filter inside a map callback creates O(n*m) complexity. If both arrays are small (under 100 elements), this completes in under 1ms and does not warrant optimization. If either grows beyond 1000 elements, consider converting to a Set for O(1) lookup. Confidence: medium -- depends on data sizes not visible in the provided code. Recommend: log array sizes in production to determine actual impact."

## Critical Bottlenecks

### N+1 Database Query Pattern -- Severity: CRITICAL

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Location** | \`orders.js:3-5\` |
| **Complexity** | Current: O(n) queries (2 per user) / Target: O(1) queries (single batch) |
| **Impact** | n=100 users: 200 DB round-trips, ~2s at 10ms/query. n=1000 users: 2000 round-trips, ~20s |
| **Frequency** | Per API request |
| **Evidence** | Sequential await inside for-loop issues one query per iteration |

**Problem**: Two database queries execute sequentially inside a loop, creating 2n total queries where n is the number of user IDs. Each query incurs network round-trip latency to the database.

**Root Cause**: The loop iterates over userIds and issues individual queries instead of batch-fetching all users and orders in two queries with IN clauses.

**Recommended Fix**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Before: 2n queries (N+1 pattern)
for (const userId of userIds) {
  const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);
  const orders = await db.query('SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1', [userId]);
}

// After: 2 queries total (batch pattern)
async function getOrderSummaries(userIds) {
  const users = await db.query(
    'SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = ANY($1)', [userIds]
  );
  const orders = await db.query(
    'SELECT user_id, amount FROM orders WHERE user_id = ANY($1)', [userIds]
  );

  const ordersByUser = new Map();
  for (const order of orders.rows) {
    if (!ordersByUser.has(order.user_id)) ordersByUser.set(order.user_id, []);
    ordersByUser.get(order.user_id).push(order);
  }

  return users.rows.map(user => {
    const userOrders = ordersByUser.get(user.id) || [];
    return {
      name: user.name,
      orderCount: userOrders.length,
      total: userOrders.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.amount, 0),
    };
  });
}
\`\`\`

**Expected Improvement**: From 2n queries to 2 queries. At n=100: ~2s reduced to ~20ms (100x). At n=1000: ~20s reduced to ~50ms (400x).
**Effort**: Medium -- requires restructuring the data-fetching logic
**Risk**: Low -- functionally equivalent, standard batch-query pattern
**Trade-offs**: Slightly more memory for the Map, negligible for reasonable n

### SELECT * Over-fetching -- Severity: MEDIUM

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Location** | \`orders.js:3-4\` |
| **Current Approach** | SELECT * fetches all columns from both tables |
| **Recommended Approach** | Select only needed columns: id, name from users; user_id, amount from orders |
| **Expected Improvement** | Reduces network transfer and memory by 50-80% depending on schema width |
| **Effort** | Low |
| **Trade-offs** | Must update column list if requirements change |

"Line 3: String concatenation in the config loader adds ~5 microseconds. Use a template literal instead."
(Context: This config loader runs once at application startup.)
  
Reason this is wrong: Premature optimization of cold code -- flagging microsecond savings in startup logic that runs once
</bad-example>

"Priority 1: Replace Array.map with a for-loop on line 45 for 10% faster iteration."
(Context: Line 45 processes a 10-element array; line 12 has a nested loop over 10000-element arrays that dominates execution time.)
  
Reason this is wrong: Missing Amdahl's Law reasoning -- optimizing a 1% contributor while ignoring the 90% contributor

[Frontend Performance Analysis]
**Frontend-Specific Bottleneck Patterns**:

- **Bundle size**: Total JavaScript sent to the client. Target: less than 200KB gzipped for initial bundle. Tools: webpack-bundle-analyzer, rollup-plugin-visualizer, source-map-explorer.
- **Rendering performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, layout thrashing (read-write-read DOM pattern), long tasks blocking the main thread (greater than 50ms). Tools: React DevTools Profiler, Chrome Performance tab.
- **Core Web Vitals targets**:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): less than 2.5s good, greater than 4.0s poor
  - INP (Interaction to Next Paint): less than 200ms good, greater than 500ms poor
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): less than 0.1 good, greater than 0.25 poor
- **Framework-specific anti-patterns**:
  - React: inline arrow functions as props causing child re-renders, missing useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations, missing React.memo for pure components
  - Vue: computed vs methods confusion (computed caches, methods do not), v-if vs v-show misuse
  - Angular: default change detection strategy on components with expensive templates
- **Resource loading**: Unoptimized images (missing width/height, wrong format, no lazy loading), render-blocking scripts, missing preload/prefetch for critical resources

[I/O Performance Analysis]
**I/O Bottleneck Identification Priority**:

1. **N+1 Queries** (highest impact): One query per item in a loop instead of a single batch query.
   - Detection: await/query call inside for/forEach/map loop body
   - Impact: n items = n+1 queries. At 10ms per query: 100 items = 1s, 1000 items = 10s
   - Fix: Batch with IN/ANY clause, use DataLoader pattern, use JOIN with grouping

2. **Missing Indexes**: Full table scans on frequently-filtered columns.
   - Detection: WHERE clause or JOIN condition on a column without an index
   - Impact: O(n) scan vs O(log n) index lookup per query. On 1M rows: ~100ms vs ~0.1ms
   - Verification: EXPLAIN ANALYZE should show Index Scan, not Seq Scan

3. **Blocking I/O in Async Contexts**: Synchronous file or network calls blocking the event loop or async runtime.
   - Detection: fs.readFileSync, requests.get, subprocess.run inside async functions
   - Impact: Blocks all concurrent operations for the duration of the I/O call
   - Fix: Use async equivalents (fs.promises, httpx.AsyncClient, asyncio.to_thread)

4. **Unbatched Network Requests**: Multiple sequential HTTP calls that could be parallelized or combined.
   - Fix: Promise.all/asyncio.gather for independent requests, batch API endpoints

[Concurrency Performance Analysis]
**Concurrency Analysis Dimensions**:

- **Parallelism opportunities**: Independent operations that could execute concurrently (Promise.all, asyncio.gather, goroutine fan-out, parallel streams)
- **Lock contention**: Mutexes, synchronized blocks, or database row locks held longer than necessary. Look for I/O operations inside lock-protected regions.
- **Thread/connection pool sizing**: Undersized pools create queuing; oversized pools waste memory and may cause contention. Rule of thumb for DB connections: (CPU cores * 2) + effective_spindle_count
- **Async anti-patterns**: Blocking calls in async functions, await in sequence when parallel is possible, missing backpressure on producers
- **Race conditions**: Shared mutable state accessed without synchronization, check-then-act patterns without atomicity
- **Goroutine/task leaks**: Spawned work that is never joined or cancelled, accumulating resource usage over time
</context>
<context>
[Caching Strategy Analysis]
**Caching Opportunity Identification**:

- **Pure function memoization**: Functions that always return the same output for the same input. Use language-native memoization (lru_cache, useMemo) or external cache (Redis).
- **Repeated expensive computations**: Same query or calculation executed multiple times per request or across requests. Profile to find repeat calls.
- **Read-heavy data with low write frequency**: Configuration, user profiles, reference data. Cache with TTL matching acceptable staleness.
- **Cache invalidation correctness**: Every caching recommendation must address how stale data is detected and refreshed. Incorrect invalidation is worse than no caching.
- **Cache sizing**: Unbounded caches cause memory leaks. Always specify maximum size or TTL.
- **Cache layers** (ordered by latency): CPU cache (ns) → in-process memory (us) → local Redis (sub-ms) → remote cache (ms) → database (ms-s)
</context>
<context>
[Memory Performance Analysis]
**Memory Analysis Patterns**:

- **Allocation in hot loops**: Object, array, or closure creation inside tight loops. Each allocation adds GC pressure. Hoist to outside the loop when possible.
- **Large object lifetimes**: References retained longer than needed prevent garbage collection. Look for closures capturing large scopes, event listeners not removed, and growing collections without bounds.
- **Memory leaks**: Resources that accumulate over time without cleanup. Common causes: event listeners, setInterval without clearInterval, WeakRef/FinalizationRegistry misuse, unclosed streams/connections.
- **Data structure overhead**: Using a Map when a plain array suffices, or a linked list when an array would have better cache locality. Consider memory layout for cache-line efficiency on large datasets.
- **String interning**: Repeated creation of identical strings in languages without automatic interning wastes memory. Consider constants or interning for high-frequency strings.

<reasoning>
For each performance finding, reason through:
1. What is the algorithmic complexity of this operation?
2. What data sizes does it operate on in realistic usage?
3. How frequently does this code path execute?
4. What fraction of total execution time does it likely represent?
5. What is the maximum possible overall speedup from optimizing it (Amdahl's Law)?
6. Is the optimization worth the implementation effort and added complexity?
Show your reasoning process.
