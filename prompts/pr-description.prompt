  <Context type="domain" label="PR Description Best Practices" priority="helpful">
    A high-quality PR description follows these principles:

    1. WHY over WHAT: The diff already shows what changed. The description should explain
       the motivation, problem being solved, and reasoning behind the approach.

    2. Audience awareness: Reviewers need to understand scope and risk. Future readers
       need historical context. Release managers need deployment impact.

    3. Structured sections: A scannable format with clear headings lets reviewers find
       what matters to them quickly.

    4. Proportional detail: Small PRs need concise descriptions. Large PRs need thorough
       organization and navigation aids.

    5. Reviewer empathy: Anticipate questions, flag tricky areas, explain non-obvious
       decisions, and suggest a review order for complex changes.

    6. Single responsibility: Each PR should address one concern. Research shows that
       25-100 lines per PR is optimal for review quality, merge speed, and revert safety.
       PRs over 400 lines show significantly declining review effectiveness.

    7. Security awareness: Changes touching authentication, authorization, input validation,
       data handling, or cryptography must explicitly document their security implications.

    8. Visual evidence: PRs affecting the user interface should include before/after
       screenshots, GIFs, or video recordings so reviewers can verify visual correctness
       without running the code.

    9. Changelog readiness: PR summaries are often used as input for automated changelog
       and release note generation. Write the summary in a way that could serve as a
       user-facing changelog entry when appropriate.

  <Steps style="structured" numbered verify>
    <Step>
      Parse the git diff to identify all modified, added, and deleted files. Extract
      commit messages if present. Build a mental model of the complete changeset.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Determine the primary purpose of the change. Classify it as feature, fix, refactor,
      breaking change, dependency update, or other. Verify alignment with the author's
      stated change type.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Group changes by functional area or component. For each group, determine WHY the
      changes were made, not just what files were touched.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Scan for breaking changes: modified public APIs, changed function signatures,
      altered database schemas, removed exports, changed configuration formats, or
      modified contracts. Flag any that require downstream consumers to adapt.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Scan for security-sensitive changes: modifications to authentication flows,
      authorization checks, input validation, cryptographic operations, secret handling,
      session management, or data exposure boundaries. Flag any that require security
      review or have security implications that reviewers should scrutinize.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Assess test coverage: identify new or modified tests in the diff, determine what
      test scenarios are needed, and compose a verification plan covering both automated
      and manual checks.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Craft the PR title: start with a verb, keep under 70 characters, do NOT use
      conventional commit type prefixes (no "feat:" or "fix:"). The title should
      communicate the user-visible or developer-visible outcome.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Compose the structured description following the output format template. Ensure
      each section serves its purpose and is proportional to the PR's complexity.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Identify reviewer focus areas: flag complex logic, security-sensitive changes,
      performance-critical paths, or architectural decisions that need careful scrutiny.
      Reference specific files and line ranges.
    </Step>

## PR Title
Add configurable session TTL to SessionManager

---

## Summary
Adds configurable time-to-live (TTL) for user sessions, allowing callers to
override the default session duration. Closes #247.

## Motivation
Sessions previously used a hardcoded expiration. Users with different security
requirements (e.g., admin sessions vs. remember-me) needed the ability to
control session lifetime per-creation.

## Changes

### Authentication (\`src/auth/session.ts\`)
- Extend \`createSession\` to accept optional \`SessionOptions\` with \`ttlSeconds\`
- Compute \`expiresAt\` timestamp from TTL, falling back to \`this.defaultTtl\`
- Pass TTL to the backing store for server-side expiration enforcement

## Breaking Changes
None. The new \`options\` parameter is optional; existing callers are unaffected.

## Test Plan
- [x] Automated: Two new unit tests verify custom TTL and default TTL behavior
- [ ] Manual: Create a session via the API with \`ttlSeconds: 60\`, confirm it
  expires after 60 seconds
- [ ] Edge cases: Verify behavior when \`ttlSeconds\` is 0, negative, or very large

## Screenshots / Visual Evidence
N/A -- no visual changes

## Security Considerations
Session TTL directly affects authentication security. Verify that:
- Minimum TTL is enforced to prevent sessions with zero or negative duration
- The backing store correctly expires sessions server-side (not relying solely on client-side expiration)

## Reviewer Notes
- **Focus areas:** \`src/auth/session.ts:17-19\` -- verify the TTL arithmetic is
  correct and handles edge values (0, negative) safely
- **Key decisions:** TTL is in seconds (not milliseconds) to match common API
  conventions and the backing store's native TTL format

## Deployment Notes
None -- standard deployment.

## PR Title
Migrate user endpoints to versioned API path

---

## Summary
Moves all user endpoints from \`/users/*\` to \`/api/v2/users/*\` as part of the
API versioning strategy. Includes migration documentation.

## Motivation
The unversioned \`/users\` path cannot support simultaneous v1 and v2 clients.
Versioned paths allow deprecation of v1 while v2 clients migrate.

## Changes

### API Routes (\`src/api/routes.ts\`)
- Move GET/POST/DELETE user routes from \`/users/*\` to \`/api/v2/users/*\`

### Documentation (\`docs/api.md\`)
- Add v1-to-v2 migration guide with redirect timeline

## Breaking Changes
- **All user endpoints have moved** from \`/users/:id\` to \`/api/v2/users/:id\`
- **Affected:** All API consumers using \`/users/*\` endpoints
- **Migration:** Update base URL to \`/api/v2\`. Old paths return 301 redirects
  for 90 days, then will return 404.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Automated: Verify all user routes respond at new \`/api/v2/users/*\` paths
- [ ] Manual: Confirm \`/users/:id\` returns 301 redirect to \`/api/v2/users/:id\`
- [ ] Edge cases: Verify redirect preserves query parameters and request body

## Screenshots / Visual Evidence
N/A -- no visual changes

## Security Considerations
None -- no security-sensitive changes. Endpoint paths changed but authentication
and authorization middleware remain unchanged.

## Reviewer Notes
- **Focus areas:** Confirm redirect middleware is in place for the 90-day
  deprecation window (not visible in this diff -- may need a follow-up PR)
- **Key decisions:** 90-day redirect window was chosen based on API analytics
  showing 99% of clients update within 60 days

## Deployment Notes
- **Feature flags:** None
- **Migrations:** None
- **Rollback plan:** Revert this commit to restore original \`/users/*\` routes.
  No data migration needed.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor 301 redirect hit rate to track client migration progress.
  Set calendar reminder to remove v1 redirects after 90-day window.
- Coordinate with API consumers before merging

  <ChainOfThought style="structured" showReasoning>
    Before writing the PR description, work through these reasoning steps:

    1. What files changed and how do they group into logical areas?
    2. What is the MOTIVATION behind these changes?
    3. Are there any breaking changes, even subtle ones?
    4. Are there any security-sensitive changes (auth, data handling, input validation)?
    5. Are there UI/visual changes that need screenshots or before/after evidence?
    6. What should a reviewer scrutinize most carefully?
    7. How can these changes be verified?
    8. What is the deployment impact and rollback plan?
    9. Is the description depth appropriate for the PR size?
    10. Could the summary serve as a changelog entry?
